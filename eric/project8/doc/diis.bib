  abstract = {An improved version of the direct inversion in the iterative subspace
	algorithm is developed. The method is significantly more efficient
	than the previous version, and is applicable to intrinsically divergent
	or slowly convergent cases. Comparisons indicate that the method
	is superior to the recently proposed quadratically convergent (QC–SCF)
	method of Bacskay.},

  abstract = {Based on a recent method of Pople et al for the solution of large
	systems of linear equations, a procedure is given for accelerating
	the convergence of slowly converging quasi-Newton— Raphson type algorithms.
	This procedure is particularly advantageous if the number of parameters
	is so large that the calculation and storage of the hessian is no
	longer practical. Application to the \{SCF\} problem is treated in
	detail. },
